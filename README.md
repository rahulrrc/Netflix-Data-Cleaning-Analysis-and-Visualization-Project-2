Project #2 for Unified Mentor Internship

Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization (Beginner ML Project)

This project involves loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from a Netflix dataset. We'll use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to work through the project. The goal is to explore the dataset, derive insights, and prepare for potential machine learning tasks.
